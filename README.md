# Hackathon Project: LSTM Component

This repository contains the code and supporting materials for our hackathon project. My primary contribution to the project was the implementation of an LSTM-based solution that plays a key role in our overall approach. The LSTM module is designed to address [insert problem domain here, e.g., "time-series prediction" or "sequence classification"] and is built using Python and popular deep learning libraries.

## Overview

During the hackathon, our team tackled [brief description of the challenge/problem]. My specific contribution was to design, implement, and integrate an LSTM module. This module:
- Processes sequential data to capture long-term dependencies.
- Offers a flexible architecture that can be adapted to different input features.
- Includes training, validation, and evaluation scripts to benchmark performance.

The goal of the LSTM component is to provide robust and accurate predictions/analyses that enhance the overall performance of our solution.

## Features

- **LSTM Model Architecture:**  
  A configurable LSTM network implemented with TensorFlow and Keras, including options for layer sizes, dropout, and activation functions.

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Scripts for cleaning and formatting input data, ensuring compatibility with the LSTM model.

- **Training and Evaluation:**  
  End-to-end pipeline to train the model on given datasets, save checkpoints, and evaluate performance using standard metrics.

- **Modularity:**  
  The code is modularized for easy integration with other parts of the hackathon project.
